## Summary
Citi Bike is a sound investment as there is a regular stream of subscribers and short-term customers making use of bikes located throughout New York City. A large majority of its users are annual subscribers and individual bike usage data exists, making it possible to predict when routine maintenance needs to be completed thus maintaining the availability of bikes for the users.
